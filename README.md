# Build an interactive form
Treehouse tech degree project 3

This is the Build an interactive form Project for the Treehouse tech degree

I will use primarily JavaScript and very little JQuery for now and will rework the project later
using JQuery. I find pure JavaScript a Challenge. 

I have checked my code in jshint and have verified that it is free of any syntax errors.

I have checked this project for cross browser compatibility in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome     - works fine
- Mozilla Firefox   - does not work completely
- Internet Explorer - displays properly without Javascript
- Opera             - works fine
