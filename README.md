# Build an interactive form
Treehouse tech degree project 3

This is the Build an interactive form Project for the Treehouse tech degree

I will use primarily JavaScript and very little JQuery for now and will rework the project later
using JQuery. JQuery will simplify the process, as I understand JQuery, I find pure JavaScript
more of a Challenge.

I will also have to tweak the CSS seeing as there is a minor flaw following my error messages.  

I have checked my code in jshint and have verified that it is free of any syntax errors.

I have checked this project for cross browser compatibility in the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Internet Explorer
- Opera
